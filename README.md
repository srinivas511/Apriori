# Apriori Algorithm
Apriori is a seminal algorithm that uses prior knowledge of frequent itemsets to iteratively find (k+1)-itemsets by using k-itemsets.
Apriori Property: All non-empty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.
Retail market basket data obtained from Belgian retail store is used as data set for this algorithm. The algorithm takes user-defined minimum support and confidence values along with the dataset to generate frequent itemsets and association rules.
